# ELEC 4700 MATLAB Demonstrations (test of windows2)

The following repo includes a number of demonstrations for [ELEC 4700][elec4700]
and [ELEC 4705][elec4705] written in MATLAB.

## Installation

Install MATLAB (or use a Carleton lab computer with MATLAB preinstalled). This
is the only prerequisite software needed to run the demonstration code in this
repo.

## Usage

MATLAB files are plain-text `.m` files and should be opened directly in MATLAB
if you wish to run them. If you would just like to edit them, any plain text
editor will suffice.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute to this code, please send a pull request.
